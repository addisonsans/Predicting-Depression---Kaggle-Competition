# Predicting Depression-Kaggle-Competition
Depression Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for my participation in a Kaggle competition focused on predicting depression using machine learning techniques. The goal of the competition was to develop a model that could accurately predict the likelihood of an individual experiencing depression based on various demographic and lifestyle factors.

Dataset
The dataset provided for this competition included a range of features such as:

Age
Gender
Work/study satisfaction
Sleep duration
Dietary habits
Family history of mental illness
And more...

The target variable was a binary indicator of the presence or absence of depression.

Approach
My approach to tackling this problem involved the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify missing values, and explore any patterns or correlations.

Data Preprocessing: I performed necessary data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming text-based features into meaningful categories.

Feature Engineering: I created new features by combining or transforming existing ones to capture more relevant information. For example, I separately considered the relevant columns for students and working professionals based on their respective factors influencing depression.

Feature Selection: I used techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance ranking to identify the most informative features and discard irrelevant or redundant ones.

Model Selection and Training: I chose the XGBoost algorithm for this task due to its strong performance on tabular data and its ability to handle complex relationships between features. I trained the model using the training data and tuned its hyperparameters using random search and cross-validation.

Model Evaluation: I evaluated the trained model on the validation set using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its performance in predicting depression.

Results
The trained XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 94.25% on the training data, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the patterns and relationships within the dataset. When applied to the unseen test data provided by the competition, the model performed exceptionally well, achieving an accuracy that was not far off from the competition winner.

Lessons Learned
Participating in this competition provided valuable insights and lessons:

The importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in improving model performance.
The significance of selecting the right machine learning algorithm and tuning its hyperparameters.
The need for comprehensive model evaluation using appropriate metrics.
The value of experimentation, iteration, and continuous learning in the field of machine learning.

Usage
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:
